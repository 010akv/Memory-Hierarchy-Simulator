# Memory-Hierarchy-Simulator
This is a C++ implementation of a two level memory hierarchy simulator with Main Memory and Cache (Direct-Mapped, 2-way Set Associative and Fully Associative). Write-through scheme is used to write data into the cache, and in the associative cache types, LRU policy is used to determine the target cache block to write data.

Memory Specifications:
Main Memory: has 512 blocks, with 4 words in each block
Cache      : has 8 blocks with 4 words in each block

Classes used in implementation:
-- Block
-- Cache
-- Main Memory
-- Memory
